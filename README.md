## Description

This a theory code presentation on the ValueTB application based on Efficiency algorithms for tables and easy table management, using algorithms and data structures along with some models of computation, all coded in Python.

Port for [ValueTB](https://github.com/Pomidorka1234/ValueTB) repository

The efficiency algorithms will also be implemented and available in C#, Javascript and other open source programming languages...

## Included extensions and Requirements

### Requirements

### Platforms & Programming Languages

### Extensions and Libraries
