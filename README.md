## Description

This a theory code presentation on the ValueTB application based on Efficiency algorithms for tables and easy table management, using algorithms and data structures along with some models of computation, all coded in Python.

Port for [ValueTB](https://github.com/Pomid0rchik/ValueTB) repository

The efficiency algorithms will also be implemented and available in C#, Javascript and other open source programming languages...

## Included extensions and Requirements

### Requirements
Python: 3.9.1 or greater

Ipython: 7.12.0 or higher

Jupyter: 6.1.12 or greater

### Software & Programming Languages
VSC, Python, Jupyter

### Recommended Extensions and Libraries

Kernels & Frameworks: Powershell, pip, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Python

## Availability for other languages & services
Table Efficiency algorithms have been implemented in [C#](https://github.com/Pomid0rchik/Table-Algorithms-CS), [JS/TS](https://github.com/Pomid0rchik/Table-Algorithms-JS-TS), contributions are welcomed to help with availability in other languages.

And will be implemented in the future in C++, Java and more...
